# Sanitize-Text

This application was created to sanitize text from a log file, by removing specific dates and other numbers that will affect a NLP application.  Currently the only supported sanitize method is for golang log files using the format that kubernetes components use, i.e. kubelet, kube scheduler, etc.

## Run

To run the container issue:

```
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 randysimpson/sanitize-text:latest
```

## Use

This program has various endpoints to utilize the sanitize text functions:

* `/upload/log` - used to upload a file to the service
* `/load/log` - used to send the data as text inside a body of a request
* `/load/text` - used to send text inside a body of a request

Currently the same sanitize function is used for all methods of sanitizing text.

## Upload

### k8's log file

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -F "file=@test.log" -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/upload/log
```

#### testing

```
ubuntu@master-1:~/code/go/src/sanitize-text$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -F "file=@test.log" -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/v1/upload/log > output.curl

```

## Installation

This is a microservice which has been written based on REST-API to allow for deployment from a docker container.

### Manual Build

To manually build the source files you will need to get the external dependencies and then build the binary executable file.

```
go get k8s.io/klog
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go build
```
